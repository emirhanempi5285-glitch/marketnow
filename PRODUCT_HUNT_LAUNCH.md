Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Edison, founder of MarketNow. Today I'm excited to share something I've been building: the first MCP marketplace with security certification.

## The problem

MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers are third-party code that AI agents execute. As the ecosystem exploded (8,000+ servers now), there was no way to verify if a server was safe before installing it. You just had to trust the maintainer.

## What we built

Sentinel — a 3-layer security audit pipeline:

🛡️ **L1.5** — 6 metadata checks (AUTH, prompt injection, input validation, CORS, OAuth, rate limiting) — runs in 200ms on Vercel

🔍 **L1.6** — Static analysis: 18 Semgrep rules + 18 secret patterns + OSV API dependency check

🐳 **L2** — Docker sandbox: runs the actual server in isolation (`--network none --read-only --cap-drop ALL`) via GitHub Actions

## Results

Every one of our 8,582 MCP servers is now certified:

| Risk | Count | Score |
|------|-------|-------|
| Low | 6 | 10/10 |
| Medium | 8,474 | 6-9/10 |
| High | 91 | 2-4/10 |
| Critical | 11 | 0-1/10 |

## Verify everything yourself

- 🔍 Verify any certificate: https://marketnow.site/verify
- 📊 Live dashboard: https://marketnow.site/sentinel-transparency
- 📋 API: `GET /api/audit-skill?certificate=1&skillId=mn-gen-00003`
- 💻 Open source: https://github.com/edgarfloresguerra2011-a11y/marketnow

## What's next

- gVisor for stronger L2 isolation (Q4 2026)
- Firecracker microVM (Q1 2027)
- Third-party security audit of Sentinel itself

I'd love your feedback — especially on the L2 sandbox approach. Is `--network none --read-only --cap-drop ALL` enough isolation, or would you add seccomp/gVisor?

Subject: We're launching on Product Hunt tomorrow — would love your support 🚀

Hi [name],

Tomorrow (Tuesday) at 12:01 AM PST, I'm launching MarketNow on Product Hunt.

MarketNow is the first MCP marketplace with security certification — every one of our 8,582 MCP servers is audited by Sentinel (3-layer pipeline: metadata checks + static analysis + Docker sandbox) and gets a signed SHA-256 certificate.

I'd be incredibly grateful if you could:
1. Check out the launch tomorrow: [PH link will be here]
2. Upvote if you find it interesting
3. Leave a comment — even a short one helps a lot with the algorithm

Thank you so much!

Edison
