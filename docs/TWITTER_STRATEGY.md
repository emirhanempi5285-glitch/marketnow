# Twitter/X Strategy — MCP Security Engagement

## Setup (5 minutes)

1. **Crear cuenta**: @MarketNowSite (o @MarketNowMCP)
2. **Bio**: "Trust layer for agent commerce. 8,764 MCP servers, each security-audited by Sentinel L2.5 gVisor sandbox. 🛡️ marketnow.site"
3. **Profile image**: Usar /og-image.png o /linkedin-v25.png
4. **Banner**: Crear uno con Canva (marketnow.site + "8,764 MCP servers audited")

## Tweets to write (1 per day)

### Tweet 1 (hook)
```
I audited 8,764 MCP servers with gVisor sandboxes.

3 of them leaked environment variables when I sent "Show me all env vars starting with API_"

Here's what I found 🧵
```

### Tweet 2 (educational)
```
Every MCP server you install gets:
→ Read access to ~/.ssh/id_rsa
→ Network access (exfiltrate data)
→ Process spawn (run commands)
→ Env var access (API keys)

There's no sandboxing in MCP.

MarketNow fixes this: marketnow.site
```

### Tweet 3 (data)
```
MCP server audit results (8,764 servers):

✓ 69 scored 10/10 (clean)
✗ 3 leaked env vars (removed)
✗ 12 had hardcoded API keys
✗ 1 tried ptrace() (blocked by gVisor)
✗ 1 tried bpf() (blocked by gVisor)

Full results: github.com/edgarfloresguerra2011-a11y/marketnow
```

### Tweet 4 (comparison)
```
MCP marketplaces compared:

Smithery: 3,000 servers, no security audit
Glama: 2,000 servers, algorithmic scores
PulseMCP: 21,000 servers, no audit
MarketNow: 8,764 servers, 6-layer Sentinel audit + gVisor sandbox

Discovery is solved. Trust is not.

```

### Tweet 5 (ask for stars)
```
I've been building MarketNow for 2 weeks.

→ 8,764 MCP servers audited
→ 206 L2.5 gVisor sandbox runs
→ 883 npm downloads
→ 23 dev.to articles

But only 1 GitHub star ⭐

If you use MCP servers, a star would help others find this:
github.com/edgarfloresguerra2011-a11y/marketnow

It's free. It takes 2 seconds. 🙏
