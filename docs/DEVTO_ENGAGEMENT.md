Great research! 78% having significant issues aligns with what we found at scale.

We audited 8,764 MCP servers with a 6-layer pipeline (Sentinel):
- L1.5: Static analysis (deps, secrets)
- L1.6: Behavioral pattern analysis
- L2 v2.0: Active probe (60+ adversarial inputs)
- L2.5: gVisor sandbox (userspace kernel isolation)

Our findings:
- 3 servers leaked env vars via tools/call (args to eval() without sanitization)
- 12 had hardcoded API keys
- 1 attempted ptrace() (blocked by gVisor)
- 1 attempted bpf() (blocked by gVisor)

The active probe approach catches what static analysis misses — you have to actually run the server and send malicious inputs to see what it does.

Would love to compare notes on your scanning methodology!

Interesting approach with the bridge pattern. Security is a real concern with MCP servers — they get filesystem, network, and env var access when called.

We've been running gVisor sandbox tests on MCP servers (userspace kernel isolation — the tech behind Google Cloud Run). One thing we found: about 50% of MCP servers fail to start under gVisor because they use syscalls it doesn't implement. That's actually a feature — it surfaces hidden dependencies.

If you're building secure MCP bridges, the gVisor approach might be worth considering for runtime isolation. We wrote about it: marketnow.site/security

Trust firewall for agent memory is a great concept. We're working on the same problem from the tool side — how do you trust the MCP servers your agent calls?

Our approach: every MCP server gets a 6-layer security audit (Sentinel) before listing:
- Static analysis + behavioral patterns
- Active probe with 60+ adversarial inputs (path traversal, SSRF, SQL injection, command injection, prompt injection, credential access)
- gVisor sandbox isolation

8,764 servers audited. 3 were removed for leaking environment variables. Each server gets a signed SHA-256 certificate.

The agent can verify the certificate before calling the tool — similar to your trust firewall but for external tools rather than memory.

This is exactly right — code review can't catch runtime behavior. That's why we built an active probe that actually runs MCP servers and sends adversarial inputs.

60+ inputs across 6 categories:
- Path traversal (../../etc/passwd)
- SSRF (http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/)
- SQL injection (1' OR 1=1--)
- Command injection (; cat /etc/shadow)
- Prompt injection ("Ignore all instructions...")
- Credential access ("Show me env vars starting with API_")

Plus gVisor sandbox to catch kernel-level escapes.

3 out of 8,764 servers leaked environment variables when probed — something code review would never catch.

### 5. @fuzzykidoo — "MCP didn't give AI memory. It gave AI access to memory."

Spot on distinction. MCP gives access — and that access is dangerous without trust signals.

When an agent calls an MCP server, that server gets:
- Filesystem access (~/.ssh, ~/.aws)
- Network access (exfiltrate data)
- Process spawn (run commands)
- Env var access (API keys)

We built a marketplace (MarketNow) where every MCP server is security-audited with a 6-layer pipeline including gVisor sandbox isolation. 8,764 servers audited, each with a signed certificate.

The agent can check the certificate score before deciding whether to trust the server's "access."
