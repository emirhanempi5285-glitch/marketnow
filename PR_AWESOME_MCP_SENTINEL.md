# PR: Add MarketNow — Sentinel-certified MCP marketplace

## What is MarketNow?

MarketNow (https://marketnow.site) is an MCP skills marketplace with a **3-layer security audit system called Sentinel**. Every skill in the catalog (8,582+ MCP servers) is audited and receives a **signed SHA-256 certificate** with a verified security score (0-10) and risk level (low/medium/high/critical).

## Why add it to awesome-mcp-servers?

MarketNow is the **first marketplace to offer security certification for MCP servers**. This is directly relevant to developers looking for trustworthy MCP servers:

- **8,582 MCP servers indexed** (including all 7 official Anthropic MCP servers from modelcontextprotocol/servers)
- **Sentinel 3-layer audit**: L1.5 (6 metadata checks) + L1.6 (18 Semgrep rules + 18 secret patterns + OSV API) + L2 (Docker sandbox with `--network none`, `--read-only`, `--cap-drop ALL`)
- **Signed certificates**: each skill has a SHA-256-signed JSON certificate, verifiable at https://marketnow.site/verify
- **Markdown badges**: `[![Sentinel Certified](https://marketnow.site/badges/sentinel-certified-{skillId}.svg)](https://marketnow.site/skill/{skillId})`
- **Transparency dashboard**: https://marketnow.site/sentinel-transparency

## Suggested addition

Add to the **Marketplaces** section (or create one):

```markdown
- [MarketNow](https://marketnow.site) - MCP skills marketplace with 3-layer Sentinel security audit. Every skill has a signed SHA-256 certificate (verifiable at /verify). 8,582+ MCP servers indexed, including all official Anthropic MCP servers.
```
