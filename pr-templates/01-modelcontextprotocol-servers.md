# PR: Add MarketNow to modelcontextprotocol/servers

**Repo:** https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers
**File to edit:** `README.md` (the curated list of MCP servers)
**Section:** "Community Servers" → "Marketplaces" (or create the section)

## PR Title

```
Add MarketNow — MCP skill marketplace with 5,054+ verified skills
```

## PR Body

```markdown
## What does this PR do?

Adds [MarketNow](https://marketnow.site) to the list of community MCP servers. MarketNow is the open marketplace for MCP-compatible agent skills — it allows any agent (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Cline) to search, discover, and install 5,054+ verified MCP skills via the Model Context Protocol.

## Why should this be added?

MarketNow is unique in the MCP ecosystem:

1. **It's a marketplace, not a single tool** — 5,054 verified skills from many authors, all in one MCP server
2. **Micro-priced for autonomous agents** — $0.99 to $9.99 per skill, one-time payment (no subscriptions)
3. **Every skill is Sentinel L1 scanned** — automated security audit (repo, README, license, secrets, malicious patterns)
4. **Public JSON API** — `/api/skills.json` returns the full catalog, no auth required
5. **MarketNow is itself installable via npx** — `npx -y marketnow-mcp`

## Stats

- **5,054** verified skills (all sourced from real GitHub repos)
- **25** categories (AI/ML, Data, Security, DevOps, Finance, etc.)
- **$0.99–$9.99** per skill (average $2.50, one-time payment)
- **100%** open-source skills (MIT, Apache-2.0, etc.)
- **npm package:** [marketnow-mcp@1.0.1](https://www.npmjs.com/package/marketnow-mcp)
